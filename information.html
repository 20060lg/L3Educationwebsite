 <i><b><p>The Precambrian period</i></b></p>
  <p>-------------------------------</p>
   
   <section>
 <i><p>         
The Precambrian is the name given to the span of time prior to the Cambrian. The Precambrian period accounts for 88 per cent of geological time.</i> </p>
   
<p><i>
 The Palaeoproterozoic and Archaean cover a very long period of geological time during which the Earth’s crust and atmosphere were developing. The only life on Earth was single celled.</P></i>

  <P><i>
In the Mesoproterozoic Era, Mudstones, sandstones and volcanic sediments were deposited in shallow seas. Multicellular life developed.

   
There are very varied deposits from the Neoproterozoic, including volcanic sequences, sedimentary rocks formed in environments from deep water to terrestrial, plutonic igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks. Multicellular life developed and diversified rapidly.</p></i>

<i><b><p>The Cambrian period</i></b></P>
 <p>-------------------------------</p>

    <section>
 <p><I>In the Cambrian Period, England and Wales lay near the south pole and experienced a cold climate. They were separate from Scotland, which was joined to North America.
   The Landmass, and the continents of which comprised the land were called Gondwana which was (a collection of today's southern continents, including Antarctica, South America, Africa, Madagascar, Australia-New Guinea, and New Zealand, as well as Arabia and India, which are in the Northern Hemisphere today) but during the Cambrian and throughout the previous periods such as the, Precambrian, the entire land was a collective unit.
   
   A shallow sea covered much of the area and animals such as trilobites, graptolites and molluscs first appeared.</p></I>
 

  
<p><I>
The Cambrian Period is the first geological time period of the Paleozoic Era the "time of ancient life". This period lasted from 541 million to 485.4 million years ago, or more than 55 million years, and marked a dramatic burst of evolutionary changes in life on Earth, known as the "Cambrian Explosion." Among the animals that evolved during this period were the chordates animals with a dorsal nerve cord; hard-bodied brachiopods, which resembled clams; and arthropods — ancestors of spiders, insects and crustaceans.</I></p>

<p><I>
Trilobites are a group of extinct marine arthropods that first appeared around 521 million years ago, shortly after the beginning of the Cambrian period, living through the majority of the Palaeozoic Era, for nearly 300 million years.</p></I>
  
<p><I>Trilobites were the first group of animals in the animal kingdom to develop complex eyes. in the Cambrian Period (about 500 million years ago). Trilobites lived in marine waters. Some trilobites could swim, others burrowed or crawled around on muddy sea floors.</p></I></section>

<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<i> <b><p>The Ordovician period</P></b></i>
  <p>-------------------------------</p>
<section>
 <P><I>
The Ordovician Period, approximately 485-444 million years ago, characterized by significant changes in the Earth's biotic, climatic, and environmental systems, including a major increase in marine life diversity and the development of the first ice age since the late Neoproterozoic.</P></I>
<p><I>
During the Ordovician period, part of the Paleozoic era, a rich variety of marine life flourished in the vast seas and the first primitive plants began to appear on land.</p></I>
  
<p><I>A new UO study confirms what scientists have long suspected; Plants first appeared on land about 460 million years ago</I></p>

<p><I>The first land plants appeared around 470 million years ago, during the Ordovician period, when life was diversifying rapidly. They were non-vascular plants, like mosses and liverworts, that didn't have deep roots. About 35 million years later, ice sheets briefly covered much of the planet and a mass extinction ensued.</I></p>
  
<P><I>
Geologists have theorized that the extinction at the end of the Ordovician was the result of a single event--Glaciation event of the entire SuperContient of Gondwana
</p></I></body>


  
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<i><b><p>The Silurian period</P></b></i>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
  <section>
<p>During the Silurian, continental elevations were generally much lower than in the present day, and global sea level was much higher. Sea level rose dramatically as the extensive glaciers from the Late Ordovician ice age melted.</p>

  <p>The Silurian witnessed a relative stabilization of the Earth's general climate, ending the previous pattern of erratic climatic fluctuations. Coral reefs made their first appearance during this time, and the Silurian was also a remarkable time in the evolution of fishes.</p>

<p>The Silurian Period occurred from 443.8 million to 419.2 million years ago. It was the third period in the Paleozoic Era. It followed the Ordovician Period and preceded the Devonian Period. During this time, continental landmasses were low and sea levels were rising</p> 

<p>The Silurian was a time of extensive reef development within the shallow and tropical Paleozoic seas. The major reef-forming animals were tabulate corals, rugose corals and stromatoporoids, an extinct type of sponge. Corals are made up of small invertebrate animals like tiny sea anemones and were becoming abundant in earths ocean's.</p>

<p>Mollusks, bryozoans, and especially brachiopods flourished, through the Silurian but trilobites and graptolites were on the decline. Invertebrates remained dominant, and vertebrate fossils are rare but known. Fish with moveable jaws appear, and the first bony fish (Osteichthyans) evolved.</p>

   
<p>Possibly the most remarkable biological event during the Silurian was the evolution and diversification of fish. Not only does this time period mark the wide and rapid spread of jawless fish, but also the appearances of both the first known freshwater fish and the first fish with jaws.</p>  
 

<p>Around 443 million years ago, 85% of all species on Earth went extinct in the Ordovician-Silurian extinction. The extinction was most likely a result of global cooling and reduced sea levels, which dramatically impacted the many marine species living in warm, shallow coastal waters and environments.</p>

   
  <p><I>440-Million-Year-Old Fossilized Fungi May Be The Oldest Land Dwellers Yet Discovered. Before the first fishy creatures stepped onto Earth's shores, the land had to become a hospitable place for life to thrive. It took billions of years for Earth's surface to morph from that barren wasteland.</I></p>
  </section>
   
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<i><b><p>The Devonian period</P></b></i>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
  <section>
<i><p>Along with the Silurian, the Devonian Period is often called the “Age of Fishes.” However, plant, invertebrate, and other vertebrate lifeforms also experienced major changes in the Devonian. For instance, land plants began to show great diversification. Additionally, the first forests appeared, and the first seeds and soils developed, allowing plants to reproduce on dry land. The oldest fossils of insects and spiders date to this time also. Early tetrapods, ancestors of land-dwelling vertebrates, first appeared during the Devonian.</i><p>
  
<p>significant changes in the world's geography took place during the Devonian. During this period, the world's land was collected into two supercontinents, Gondwana and Euramerica. These vast landmasses lay relatively near each other in a single hemisphere, while a vast ocean covered the rest of the globe.</p>

   <p>Red-colored sediments, generated when North America collided with Europe, give the Devonian its name, as these distinguishing rocks were first studied in Devon, England. The Devonian, part of the Paleozoic era, is otherwise known as the Age of Fishes, as it spawned a remarkable variety of fish.</p>

<p><I>
The vegetation of the early Devonian consisted primarily of small plants, the tallest being only a meter tall. By the end of the Devonian, ferns, horsetails and seed plants had also appeared, producing the first trees and the first forests.</I></p>

<P><I>During the Devonian, two major animal groups colonized the land. The first tetrapods — land-living vertebrates — appeared during the Devonian, as did the first terrestrial arthropods, including wingless insects and the earliest arachnids. In the oceans, brachiopods flourished.</I></P>
    
  <p><I>By the Middle Devonian, shrub-like forests of primitive plants existed: lycophytes, horsetails, ferns, and progymnosperms evolved. Most of these plants had true roots and leaves, and many were quite tall. The earliest-known trees appeared in the Middle Devonian.</I></p>
<P><I>By the the Middle Devonian, placoderms, the first jawed fish, appear. Many of these grew to large sizes and were fearsome predators. Of the greatest interest to us is the rise of the first sarcopterygians, the lobe-finned fish, which eventually produced the first tetrapods just before the end of the Devonian.</I></P>

 <p><I>By the Late Devonian, lycophytes, sphenophytes, ferns, and progymnosperms had evolved. Most of these plants have true roots and leaves, and many grew quite tall. The progymnosperm Archaeopteris was a large tree with true wood.
</I></p> 

<P><I>By the Late Devonian, the land had been colonized by plants and insects. In the oceans, massive reefs were built by corals and stromatoporoids. Euramerica and Gondwana were beginning to converge into what would become Pangaea. The extinction seems to have only affected marine life.</I></P>

<I><b><p>The Carboniferious period</P></b></I>
  <p>-------------------------------</p>
<section>
<I><p>The Carboniferous Period lasted from about 359.2 to 299 million years ago* during the late Paleozoic Era. The term "Carboniferous" comes from England, in reference to the rich deposits of coal that occur there. These deposits of coal occur throughout northern Europe, Asia, and midwestern and eastern North America.
</p></I>

   <P><I>During the Carboniferous, many new groups of plants evolved and great forests grew in the tropical swamps and deltas. Trees were not like those we know today, but mainly clubmosses and horsetails, and the earliest gymnosperms (seed-bearing plants) like conifers and seed ferns also developed. The first fossilized plants were the conifers, which were the first plants to grow on land. </I></P>
   
 <p><I>The Carboniferous Period was a period of great, luscious vegetation and rain forest-like environments. Lasting from 360 to 299 m.y.a, today's coal industry can thank this period which is known for its boggy, peaty conditions that eventually led to the coal deposits that we mine today.</p></I>

<p><I></I></p>

  <p><I>Vegetation included giant club mosses, tree ferns, great horsetails, and towering trees with strap-shaped leaves. Over millions of years, the organic deposits of this plant debris formed the world's first extensive coal deposits
coal that humans are still burning today.
  </I></p>  

<P><I>When plants died in these waterlogged regions, many fell into stagnant pools with little oxygen. Since most decomposers (bacteria, fungi, worms and the like) can't survive in such conditions, the plants never fully decayed. Instead they formed peat, an accumulation of partially decayed organic material.</I></P>
  
 <p><I>The problem arose when those trees reached the end of their lives; fungi are the major rotters of wood but at that time, no organism on earth had the ability to break down lignin, and especially not lignin in such quantities. So, as more and more trees died, they simply lay where they fell and turned to peat</I></p>

<p><I>The growth of these forests removed huge amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, leading to a surplus of oxygen.</I></p>
  
 
  <p><I>Animals of the Carboniferous Period include amphibians, which became the dominant land vertebrates; sharks, which dominated the oceans; arthropods, which grew to much bigger sizes than today; and amniotes, the ancestors of modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.</I></p>

 <P><I>During the Carboniferous Period, the climate of various landmasses was controlled by their latitudinal position. Since prevailing wind patterns were similar to those on Earth today, tropical conditions characterized the equatorial regions; the midlatitudes were dry, and higher latitudes were both cooler and moist.</I></P> 
  
<p><I>The later half of the period experienced glaciations, low sea level, and mountain building as the continents collided to form Pangaea. A minor marine and terrestrial extinction event, the Carboniferous rainforest collapse, occurred at the end of the period, caused by climate change.</I></p>
 
  <p><I>The Carboniferous rainforest collapse (CRC) was a minor extinction event that occurred around 305 million years ago in the Carboniferous period. The event occurred at the end of the Moscovian and continued into the early Kasimovian stages of the Pennsylvanian (Upper Carboniferous).</I></p>

<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<I><b><p>The Permian period</P></b></I>
  <p>-------------------------------</p>
<section>
<P><I>The Permian Period began 298.9 million years ago and ended 252.2 million years ago, extending from the close of the Carboniferous Period to the outset of the Triassic Period.</I></P>
  
<p><I>in the permian Plant life consisted mostly of ferns, conifers and small shrubs. Animals included sharks, bony fish, arthropods, amphibians, reptiles and synapsids. The first true mammals would not appear until the next geological period, the Triassic.</I></p>

  <P><I>The early Permian saw the continuation of the Carboniferous biomes, with polar tundra regions and warm wet tropical swamp forests. But the drying climatic tendency during the mid Permian spelled death for the mighty swamp forests.</I></P>

<P><I>Middle Permian climates generally were warmer and moist. Climates of the Late Permian (Lopingian) Epoch were typically hot and locally very dry. Deserts became widespread in various tropical and subtropical areas during this time.</I></P>
  
<P><I>Two important groups of animals dominated the Permian landscape: Synapsids and sauropsids. Synapsids had skulls with a single temporal opening and are thought to be the lineage that eventually led to mammals. Sauropsids had two skull openings and were the ancestors of the reptiles, including dinosaurs and birds.</I></P>
  
  <p><i>The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The southern continent saw extensive seed fern forests of the Glossopteris flora. Oxygen levels were probably high there.</i></p>
  
<I><p>During the Permian Period, Earth's crustal plates formed a single, massive continent called Pangaea. In the correspondingly large ocean, Panthalassa, marine organisms such as brachiopods, gastropods, cephalopods (nautiloids and ammonoids), and crinoids were present. On land, reptiles replaced amphibians in abundance.</p></I>


  <p><I>And During the Permian Period, all the world's landmasses were joined into a single continent that spread from pole to pole. Pangaea was shaped like a huge letter “C” facing eastward. The open part of the letter cupped the Tethys Ocean.</I></p>

  <P><I>The Climate warmed throughout the Permian times, and, by the end of the period, hot and dry conditions were so extensive that they caused a crisis in Permian marine and terrestrial life. This dramatic climatic shift may have been partially triggered by the assembly of smaller continents into the supercontinent of Pangea.</I></P>

<P><I></I></P>
  <P><I>Scientists believe volcanic eruptions in the Siberian Traps ultimately caused the end-Permian mass extinction by creating or enhancing extinction drivers like polluted soil and acidic rain.</I></P>


  <P><I>What resulted is The largest extinction in Earth's history which marked the end of the Permian period, some 252 million years ago. Long before the dinosaurs, our planet was populated with plants and animals that were mostly obliterated after a series of massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia</I></P>
  
  <P><I>With more than 95% of marine species becoming extinct, life in Permian seas, once a thriving and diverse ecosystem, was wiped out within only tens of thousands of years, a geological blink of an eye. This is now referred to as the 'Great Dying', a period when life on Earth has never been so close to becoming extinct</I></P>


  <P><I>Important groups of marine animals disappeared at the end-Permian extinctions. Trilobites, which had lived in the oceans for more than 250 million years, were lost, along with tabulate and rugose corals. Reef building in shallow seas stopped for about 14 million years until the middle of the following Triassic Period.</I></P>


  
  <P><I>The groups that survived suffered extremely heavy losses of species and some terrestrial vertebrate groups very nearly became extinct at the end of the Permian. Some of the surviving groups did not persist for long past this period, but others that barely survived went on to produce diverse and long-lasting lineages.</I></P>

<I><B><p>The Triassic period</P></B></I>
 <p>-------------------------------</p>
<section>
<P><I>The Triassic Period (252-201 million years ago) began after Earth's worst-ever extinction event devastated life. The Permian-Triassic extinction event, also known as the Great Dying, took place roughly 252 million years ago and was one of the most significant events in the history of our planet.</I></P>


  <P><I>At the beginning of the Triassic, virtually all the major landmasses of the world were collected into the supercontinent of Pangea. Terrestrial climates were predominately warm and dry (though seasonal monsoons occurred over large areas), and the Earth's crust was relatively quiescent.</I></P>

  <P><I>The environment during the Triassic was as varied as it is today, with large swathes of forests, dry deserts and open prairies. 'The global effect of this supercontinent would have been a greatly enhanced seasonality in different parts of it.</I></P>

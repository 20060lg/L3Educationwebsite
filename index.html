        <p>Paleontology is packed with mysteries about living things such as plants and animals that lived thousands, millions, and billions of years before the first modern humans. To solve these mysteries, paleontologists use fossils.

Fossils are the remains or traces of ancient life that are usually buried in rocks. Examples include bones, teeth, shells, leaf impressions, nests, and footprints. This evidence reveals what our planet was like long ago. Fossils also show how animals changed over time and how they are related to one another.</p>

      The fossil record as we know it today is strongest in the last 550 million years of life, but we do have fossils reaching back as far as 3 billion years and beyond. Most of these fossils are of what we would call invertebrate animals, that is, those without backbones, like clams, starfish, sponges, and trilobites. Individual fossil types are commonly preserved with those of other species in groups called assemblages. These assemblages reflect species that commonly live together or died together, or at least were preserved together. The assemblages are characteristic of very specific intervals in geologic history, and of very specific environments within those time intervals; for example, the snails and clams on a tidal mudflat from the Miocene Epoch, or the corals and sponges from a Jurassic reef. These assemblages change from time, preserved in the rock record, in a regular and non-random way; they are not found out of place or sequence, any more than a tri-corner hat from the Revolutionary War is found in an Egyptian tomb.

Fossils and assemblages of land plants and animals are frequently abundant, too, but not as much as the marine invertebrates; they tell their own story about the evolution of life on land.

      <p>Paleontologists are often asked whether they have complete sequences of fossils, and how many of our forms are truly transitional. Of course our fossil sequences are not complete, any more than any human historical sequence is complete. The genealogy of the Bible, the teachings of Jesus, and the works of Aristotle are incompletely known, even though they occurred near thousands of years ago, whereas the fossil record encompasses billions of years. But as with a book missing many pages, or a film with many of its frames cut out, the plot and the sense can largely be reconstructed. Besides, for numerous shorter intervals the fossil record is amazingly complete in some respects, and this gives us a very good picture, we think, of how evolution generally operates at this scale.</p></i>
